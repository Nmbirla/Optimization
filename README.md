Make  the  program  to  solve  this  problem  using each of the following methods starting  with the  point (x01,x02) =  (0,0). 
(a) Steepest decent  method  for  which  the  stepsize  at  each iteration is selected using the minimization rule.
(b) Newton’s method for which the stepsize at each iteration is selected using the Armijo rule with s= 1,σ= 0.1, andβ= 0.5.

## Conditional gradient Method
Use the conditional gradient method with the limited min-imization stepsize rule for the following problem:
